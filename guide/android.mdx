  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 2">
    After installing the first application, open it and log in to your Apple Music account(`Subscription required`). We will proceed to configure the second application.

    Open the second application, ZeroTermux, and grant the required permissions as prompted. Next, enter the following commands to configure the environment and pull the download repository (press Enter to accept the default for any Y/N prompts that appear during the process).

    ```
    pkg update && pkg upgrade && pkg install git golang gpac ffmpeg && git clone https://github.com/zhaarey/apple-music-alac-atmos-downloader.git
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 3">
    In the ZeroTermux application, swipe left from the right edge of the screen to open the file manager. Navigate to `home`,  `apple-music-alac-atmos-downloader`,  `config.yaml`. Choose the first option to edit the file.
    <Tip>On Android, it is recommended to modify two values to change the storage location; otherwise, the files will be saved in the Termux application directory.</Tip>

    ```
    alac-save-folder: /storage/emulated/0/Music/AM/AM-DL downloads
    atmos-save-folder: /storage/emulated/0/Music/AM/AM-DL-Atmos downloads
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
